...fearless on my breath, teardrop on the fire...

...Telegram Sam, you're my main man...

...hangin' low today, I replace the highway, love's the only way, licking hands the wrong way...

...young loving may be so extreme, maybe we should try the same old scene...

...The easy way to say "okay", twist your knife a little deeper, words so sharp, action's dark, hide the blade of the deceiver...
